FEATURE IMPORTANCE GRAPHS (Bar Charts)
===============================================================

1. feature_importance_top20.png
   ✓ Bar chart of 20 most important features
   ✓ Color-coded by category
   ✓ Top 3: Gyeonggi (50.8%), Seoul (27.8%), Busan (3.2%)

2. feature_importance_by_category.png
   ✓ Aggregated importance by feature type
   ✓ Regional: 78.6%, Climate: 15%, Temporal: 4.3%

3. experimental_features_importance.png
   ✓ NEW time series features (lags 2, 5, 8, 12 days)
   ✓ 5 features with rolling means on lag features

===============================================================
ACTUAL VS PREDICTED GRAPHS
===============================================================

4. actual_vs_predicted_timeseries.png
   ✓ Full 2019-2023 overlay (blue=actual, orange=predicted)
   ✓ R² = 0.946 | RMSE = 5.58 | MAE = 2.10

5. actual_vs_predicted_2022_sample.png
   ✓ Detailed view of 2022 for clarity
   ✓ Shows daily prediction accuracy

6. actual_vs_predicted_scatter.png
   ✓ Each point = one day's prediction
   ✓ Red dashed line = perfect prediction
   ✓ Orange line = fitted trend

7. residuals_plot.png
   ✓ Checking for systematic errors
   ✓ Points should scatter randomly around zero

8. distribution_comparison.png
   ✓ Density curves comparing actual vs predicted
   ✓ Overlapping distributions = good calibration

===============================================================
MODEL PERFORMANCE
===============================================================

All Data (29,635 samples):
  R² = 0.946  (94.6% variance explained)
  RMSE = 5.58 cases
  MAE = 2.10 cases

Test Set Only (holdout):
  R² = 0.798  (79.8% variance explained)
  RMSE = 13.59 cases
  MAE = 6.44 cases

Note: Test set performance is more realistic for unseen data

===============================================================
KEY INSIGHTS FROM VISUALIZATIONS
===============================================================

✓ Regional patterns dominate (Gyeonggi + Seoul = 78.6%)
✓ Day of week is highly predictive (4th most important)
✓ Model captures seasonal and weekly patterns
✓ Environmental factors have subtle but measurable effects
✓ Experimental lag features (2, 5, 8, 12 days) selected
✓ Snow depth is most important environmental variable
